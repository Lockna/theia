# theia
An ELF/MachO linker for various architectures written in Rust 

## About
theia is a linker learning project for myself.
It is planned to support atleast the following architectures:
 - x86-64
 - ARM
 - Aarch64
 - RISC-V
 
Others are also planned to be implemented, but do not have any priority:
 - MIPS32
 - MIPS64
 - SPARC v9

Focus will be set on ELF files. Mach-O files are planned but not prioritise.
